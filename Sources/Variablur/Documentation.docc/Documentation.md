# ``Variablur``

Apply variable blur effects to SwiftUI views.

## Overview

With Variablur, you can create variable blur effects that you control with a mask. Because you draw the mask using a `GraphicsContext`, it can contain gradients, shapes, text, pre-rendered images, or anything else you can draw into a `GraphicsContext`.
